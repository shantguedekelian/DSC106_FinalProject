Its extent of occurrence in Europe is 2,811 km² and it occurs at five locations.  Out of the European region, this species ranges from Fethiye to Finike, in southwestern Anatolia, Türkiye, where it apparently has a fragmented distribution that constitutes three distinct subspecies.

This species is associated with karstic limestone outcrops, in the boulder fields at the foot of karstic rock (Veith et al. 2001).  The species is viviparous, producing one or two fully metamorphosed young; the gestation period is about one year (Baran et al. 2021). It is active and quite abundant during the wet period of the year, which lasts from November to April in Mediterranean Type Ecosystems (Polymeni et al. 2011). Kastelorizo has no own water resources, and it is dependent on annual precipitation.

2865,Bombina bombina,67862807,"In the European region, this species is found in central and eastern Europe ranging from Denmark, southern Sweden and northern Germany eastwards to the Ural Mountains of Russia, southwards to the Danube floodplain and along the lowlands of the Morava River and its tributaries in Serbia, and to Turkish Thrace. It has been introduced to the United Kingdom (one colony in Surrey), to mainland France (not mapped), and Crimea (Ukraine, not mapped). It is a lowland species that occurs from sea level up to a maximum of 730 m asl (in western Bohemia). The extent of occurrence (EOO) in the EU 27 region is 1,577,192 km².  Out of the European region, the range of this species extends to the northern slopes of the Caucasus Mountains, western parts of Anatolian Türkiye (around Adapazari), western Kazakhstan and the Trans-Ural part of Russia (Chelyabinskaya oblast).",Done,Palearctic,"This species remains fairly abundant over much of its range (for example it is extremely common to the north and west of the Danube floodplain where it has benefited from increased irrigation), although many northern populations have declined (e.g., in Poland and Germany). The subpopulations of this species in both Denmark and Sweden are low. Individual subpopulations of this species can show significant fluctuations in numbers. There are no recent records from Greece, but its range in this country has not been surveyed for many years. The species is common in parts of European Russia, Ukraine and Moldova, and while it is unlikely to be declining on this territory in general, many local subpopulations are declining. The overall European population trend is suspected to be declining, but not at a significant level at present.",Decreasing,"Within Europe this species is associated with lowland areas of marshy or grassy wetlands, often along river valleys, with small, shallow, often-temporary lakes and ponds. In the former Soviet Union it has been reported from steppe, forest steppe, broad-leaved and mixed leafed coniferous forests, but it also inhabits open landscapes, using drainage channels as pathways for dispersal. At the southeastern margin of its distribution, the species lives in permanent freshwater bodies in river valleys surrounded by an arid saline landscape (solonetz-solonchak complex). It is primarily an aquatic animal living in shallow (less than 50-70 cm depth) stagnant lakes, ponds, pools, swamps, peat bogs, ditches, flooded rice fields and quarries. It may occasionally be found in semi-flowing waters: springs, irrigation channels, rivers and stream pools and the water must generally be clear (for example in the Carpathian region, B. bombina lives in wetlands with clearer water than the congeneric Bombina variegata); however, near the southern margin of the range (such as southeastern Ukraine and the Krasnodar region of South European Russia, out of the Pan Europe assessment region) the species often occurs in waters that have been polluted with industrial and agricultural chemicals such as settling and sedimentation reservoirs, rice fields, polluted ponds in rural and urban areas. The species breeds by larval development in pools with a good growth of sub-aquatic vegetation. Hybrid subpopulations of this species with B. variegata have been recorded (Vörös et al. 2006).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),The species is collected for the ornamental/pet trade.,"In western and northern Europe the species is threatened by the loss of habitat through modernisation of agricultural methods, most significantly the drainage and/or pollution of suitable wetland areas. Recent declines in northwestern Europe might also be related to climate change. In the Balkans it is threatened by urban development and agricultural development. Within the former Soviet Union destruction of wetlands is also the most serious threat, although industrial pollution and recreational activities also impact populations. Additional localized threats to this species include mortality on roads, entrapment in open wells with vertical walls, hybridisation and replacement by Bombina variegata and collection for the pet trade. However, at a global scale this species is not significantly threatened.","This species is listed on Appendix II of the Bern Convention and on Annexes II and IV of the EU Natural Habitats Directive.

22212,Triturus cristatus,200183152,"This species is widely distributed from the United Kingdom and northern France, through southern Scandinavia, and central Europe, enters a small part of the Balkans (easternmost Serbia and a small part of northwestern Bulgaria), and spreads to the easternmost edge of the continent (European Russia). The presence of this species in Aggtelek region, north-eastern Hungary, was both morphologically and genetically proved, but mostly forms hybrid populations with Triturus dobrogicus (Vörös and Major 2007, Halpern et al. 2019). This species was recently recorded in Bulgaria (Tzankov and Stojanov 2008). It has an altitudinal range from sea level to 1,750 m asl. (Arnold 2003).  Beyond the European region, the species range extends to Asia, to the southwestern part of West Siberia (Kurganskaya Province).",Done,Palearctic,"Although the species is known to be declining or rare in parts of its distribution (Denoël 2012), it appears to remain relatively common in suitable habitats in some other parts of its range. However, population sizes are small in several parts of the range, particularly in geographic areas where declines have been highlighted (Denoël et al. 2013). Improved fiеld methods (aquatic funnel traps) of recent years can mask declines in the species. Some papers show declines in the species but there are few reliable assessments of the status (Cruickshank et al. 2016).",Decreasing,"It can be found in coniferous, mixed and deciduous forests (composed of pine, birch, oak, alder etc.), their glades and edges, in forest steppe, bush lands, pastures, meadows, parks and gardens. In some parts of its range, it avoids ponds inside forests. It seems that higher amounts of deciduous forest and pasture, together with proximity to deciduous forest seem to be positive for the presence of Great Crested Newts, while coniferous forest and mire appear to have a negative effect on the habitat quality for the species (Gustafson et al. 2011). Reproduction takes place in permanent stagnant and in semi-flowing waters such as ponds, rarely lakes, flooded quarries, irrigation channels and ditches. The usage of small ponds is typical across the range. It can be found in modified habitat types, but this species is not considered to be very adaptable. Drainage ditches can represent important aquatic habitats for this species, which needs to be considered in restoration activities (Hartel et al. 2011).  Connectivity at multiple scales is essential for the preservation with a high density of ponds favouring its presence in aquatic habitats (Denoël et al. 2013). In pond networks, a large part of populations is not site faithful, dispersing between ponds within and among breeding seasons, also suggesting the importance of connectivity (Denoël et al. 2018). The importance of habitat features at a close range to ponds has been highlighted both for the use of aquatic habitats and genetic richness (Denoël et al. 2013; Cox et al. 2021). Introduced fish Perccottus glenii strongly prey on tadpoles of this species causing a strong decline in the number of local populations in Russia (Reshetnikov 2001).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),This species is collected for the commercial pet trade.,"The species is sensitive to changes in water quality. Correspondingly, industrial pollution of water, destruction and drainage of ponds seem to be negative factors for T. cristatus.  Polluted waters have been reported to impact negatively its occurrence in agricultural ponds (Denoël et al. 2013). Lack of connectivity among breeding sites, and the presence of introduced fish also threaten the survival of local crested newts (Denoel et al. 2013). The impact of natural factors such as ponds overgrowing, shallowing and eutrophication is harmful to urban populations and those near to the range margins.  Being recognised also as a species which uses lotic habitats, it was considered as potentially threatened by the establishment of run-of-river small hydropower plants in the part of the Carpathian region which enters the Balkan Peninsula (Crnobrnja-Isailović et al. 2021). Introduced predatory fishes are leading to declines in some areas. Contemporary agricultural practices (e.g. glyphosate application on the arable fields) coincide with species seasonal migrations (Berger et al. 2013). In some parts of the range (of the former Soviet Union), there is substantial commercial collecting of this species for the pet trade. Habitat fragmentation is a threat. Additionally, it was revealed that low annual survival is related to mild winters and heavy rainfall, which impact the metapopulation at the regional level (Griffiths et al. 2010).","Conservation In Place Listed on Appendix II of the Bern Convention, and there is an Action Plan.

The full extent of its range is possibly not fully known, and is still being investigated in central France (Arntzen et al. 2013, Trujillo et al. 2017), where it occurs in some areas with or near Bufo bufo, with which it can be confused. It is known to occur from about sea level to 2,600 m in the Spanish Pyrenees (García-París 2004). It occurs in the Spanish enclave of Ceuta in North Africa.  The range of the species extends out of the European region to North Africa (Morocco, northern Algeria and extreme north-western Tunisia; Ben Hassine and Nouira 2012, Beukema et al. 2013; Ben Hassine and Escoriza 2014, 2017), where its range is fragmented (Arntzen et al. 2013).",Done,Palearctic,"This species is generally common over much of its range, though some declines have been observed, e.g. in Jersey (Wilkinson et al. 2007) and Spain. Due to ongoing local declines in the extent and quality of its habitat, the population is inferred to be decreasing.",Decreasing,"This is a widespread species in western Europe with a large latitudinal range. It exploits a variety of habitats across that range including woodlands, shrublands, heathlands, dunes and more arid areas, as well as anthropogenically modified habitats such as farmland and gardens. In the north of its range (Jersey), it breeds commonly in small, still ponds of anthropogenic origin, as well as temporary (e.g. dune slack) ponds (Wilkinson et al. 2007), but exhibits broader habitat preferences further south, also breeding in more permanent water bodies including streams and stream pools (Iberia) (Da Fonseca et al. 2008, Gómez-Rodríguez et al. 2009, Ben Hassine and Escoriza 2014). In southern France, it is known from a broad range of natural and artificial breeding sites, although it does not tolerate salinity and is absent from coastal habitats (Geniez and Cheylan 2012; P.A. Crochet pers. comm. 2020). It readily colonizes modified and fully artificial habitats (such as concrete cisterns) and is more tolerant than sympatric frogs of the presence of fish (Crochet et al. 2004, Geniez and Cheylan 2012; P.A. Crochet pers. comm. 2020).  The species begins reproduction much earlier in the year, on average, than other, similar species (including B. bufo) with spawning occurring commonly from just after the annual thermal minimum (in December and January) through to March or even later, in both the north and south of its range (e.g. Díaz-Paniagua et al. 2005, Cistude Nature 2010, Artnzen et al. 2014). Reproduction is very variable, however, and may be delayed by a lack of suitable water bodies.  The maximum size of males of this species is 16 cm (11 in the north of the range), with females being larger than males (Speybroeck et al. 2016). Hemelaar (1988) reported the life history of a subpopulation from France and found that males generally reach sexual maturity at four to five years of age and females at five to six, although a small proportion can be sexually mature at three (male) or four (female) years. J. Wilkinson (pers. comm. August 2018) suggests that males can reach maturity as young as two years of age; P.A. Crochet (pers. comm. 2020) considers that very few if any males are likely to mature this young. Longevity is 12 years for males and 15 for females (J. Wilkinson pers. comm. 2018).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),There are no records of this species being utilised.,"There are generally no major threats to this common species. However, some subpopulations may be affected by deforestation, drainage of wetlands, pollution, agricultural intensification, urbanisation, desertification, mortality on roads during migration (of which this species is a ""frequent victim""; J. Ben Hassine pers. comm. 2020), increased UV-B radiation and persecution. Land-use changes (including agricultural practices and urbanisation) and climate change are also likely to impact some subpopulations by reducing foraging areas and breeding site availability, as well as causing fragmentation (J. Wilkinson pers. comm. August 2018). It is however, not clear whether these species have negative impacts on B. spinosus where they co-occur (Chillasse et al. 2002; Ben Hassine and Escoriza 2014, 2017; Escoriza 2018).  The species has declined extensively in Spain due to habitat loss and aridity (I. Martínez-Solano pers. comm. August 2019). In Spain, it was persecuted as it was seen as 'ugly', however, as local awareness is increasing that the species is being seen in lower numbers, persecution is decreasing (I. Martinez-Solano pers. comm. September 2019). In Spain, they are also affected by road mortality, as well as by predation of eggs and tadpoles by invasive crayfish (Procambarus clarkii). Since they are not good climbers or swimmers, they often die trapped in man-made waterbodies such as water tanks and cisterns, abandoned or in use.  Chytridiomycosis is a potential threat to the species and has been reported in some Spanish subpopulations.

(2019), is now considered to occur through much of Europe, with an eastern limit of the Volga River drainage - the area of the Volga and Kama rivers (Amphibian Species of the World; Frost 2020). The range of this species also includes subpopulations from the eastern Mediterranean countries (see Stöck et al. 2006, Dufresnes et al. 2019) and possibly subpopulations from the southern tip of Sweden, Denmark and northern Germany that were also provisionally identified as Bufotes (Bufo) variabilis by Stöck et al. (2006). The identity of Green Toad records on the island of Malta is unclear, and is retained here in Bufotes viridis pending further research. Subpopulations from much of Italy, including the island of Sardinia, some major circum-Sardinian islands (Corti et al. 2006) and the easternmost parts of Sicily, also island of Corsica (France), and the Balearic Islands of Spain (where it was probably introduced in prehistoric times), all previously assigned as Bufotes balearicus, are now synonymized with B. viridis. The species is absent from much of Fenno-Scandia, the British Isles, the Iberian Peninsula and almost all of Europe west of the Rhine River. The species occurs throughout the Greek mainland (including Peloponnese) and it has been recorded on many islands, including Crete and the East Aegean islands (Graham et al. 2020; Pafilis and Maragou 2020, Dufresnes et al. 2021, Strachinis 2022; I. Strachinis pers. records).  Following Frost (2020), the range of this species out of the European region now extends east of the Volga and Kama rivers valley (Faizulin et al. 2018) to the Udmurtia region in Russia (S. Litvinchuk pers. comm. October 2022), with an isolated subpopulation along the Ob River in Siberia likely to result from human introduction (Dufresnes et al. 2019). B. sitibundus is now synonymised with B. viridis. Therefore, the Green Toad also reaches northwestern Anatolia and the Caucasus region, from southeastern Kazakhstan to the southwestern Caspian shores, and central Uzbekistan. Frost (2020) further recognises two lineages: the Eastern lineage is associated with the arid lowlands from the Amu-Darya to the south (western Afghanistan and Uzbekistan), towards the eastern side of the former Aral Sea, the middle and lower Syr-Darya flow, eastern side of the Turgai Depression, the lower Talas and Chu River drainages and Balkhash Lake basin, to the western foothills of the Tian-Shan system; the Western lineage is found mostly in arid mountainous areas of southwestern Turkmenistan and northeastern Iran (Khorasan), possibly extending into southwestern Tajikistan and northern Kyrgyzstan. Former subpopulations from North Africa are now assigned B. boulengeri, as well as Green Toad subpopulations from Sicily which were previously considered as the endemic B. siculus, with some subpopulations of B. viridis in the northeast of this island.

Crnobrnja-Isailović pers. comm. January 2022). In Germany site development of fallow land causes a loss of habitat. On the Balearic Islands, where the origin of the species is uncertain, loss and degradation of breeding habitat has resulted from excessive water abstraction, urbanisation, the decline of traditional agricultural practices and pollution with agrochemicals. Fragmentation as a result of road construction is also a problem.

A review of research on the origins of European subpopulations suggests that its occurrence in both mainland Europe and offshore islands represents the result of human introductions in antiquity (Dufresnes and Alard 2020).

It has possibly been introduced to Switzerland, although this requires further confirmation.  This is a very wide-ranging species. Its native range is from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, southern Quebec, Canada, south to eastern North America, except southern Florida, USA, then southward through Veracruz, Mexico. It is also found in Sinaloa, and probably other areas in Mexico, as well. This species was introduced to Mexico at the beginning of the last century. It was introduced to 'La Garita' in Costa Rica but now appears to be extinct in this country (G. Chaves pers. comm.). It is also introduced in Cuba, Puerto Rico (introduced 1935), Hawaii (introduced mid- to late 1800s, now on all main islands), Isla de la Juventud, Hispaniola (only confirmed in northern and eastern Dominican Republic, not in Haiti) and Jamaica. Its range is increasing in some areas.  The species is introduced to South America. In Venezuela, there is an expanding population near La Azulita, in Mérida state, at the Andean versants facing Lake Maracaibo basin. In Colombia, it is known from the Middle Magdalena Valley, north to the lowlands on the Caribbean coast. It has also been found in Bogotá, although it is not known whether it has established a population there. In Peru, it has become established around Iquitos in central Loreto Department in the Amazon Basin, and also around Lima on the Pacific coast. There are also a number of populations established in Ecuador and Brazil. It has been introduced in Rincón de Pando, Canelones, Uruguay, and in Misiones, Argentina. In Asia, where it is also introduced, it is found in several localities in the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore. It has also been introduced to mainland China and Taiwan, Province of China, for raising in farms for human consumption. Feral populations have become established in Taiwan, Province of China, Kunming in Yunnan province, Sichuan, Xinjiang and possibly other places in China as a result of escape or deliberate release.

The tadpoles require a long development period of three months (Disi et al. 2014).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),There are no records of this species being utilised.,"The species is generally threatened by habitat destruction through drainage or loss of breeding wetlands and conversion of land to agricultural and industrial use, and related water pollution but the scale and impact of these threats in European Türkiye are not known.  In European Türkiye, forested and semi-natural areas have been destroyed over the years, particularly due to the expansion of artificial areas, which continue to increase. The Ergene River basin is the most important aquatic habitat in the Thrace region and is intensively exposed to agricultural, domestic and industrial pollution (Tokatlı and Atılgan Helvacıoğlu 2020).  There is high negative impact of tourism development on suitable habitats of this species in the Greek part of its range, and it is very vulnerable to land alterations and pollution (I. Strachinis pers. comm. November 2022).  Climate change is having a significant impact on wetlands in the region, and this may impact the species (Cohen et al. 2021).","Conservation Actions In-Place  It is recorded in a national and subnational Red Data Books and Lists. In Greece, the species occurs in several protected areas: Lemnos - GR4110001 and SPA site GR4110006; Lesvos - GR4110004, GR4110003 (also SPA sites GR4110012 and GR4110010). The presence in protected areas in European Türkiye is not confirmed.  Research Needed Further presence and status surveys are needed in parts of its range or potential range. The potential occurrence of the species in adjacent parts of Bulgaria requires confirmation through the study of specimens from this part of its potential range. Confirmation of the distribution in Turkish Thrace is also needed.  Conservation Needed Long-term monitoring throughout the species range.",3.1,TRUE,NT,,A2ac,FALSE,FALSE,,,21/02/2023,"European regional assessment: Near Threatened (NT) EU 27 regional assessment: Endangered (EN)  In Europe, this species is restricted to a small number of records from the European part of Türkiye and on three Greek islands - Lemnos, Lesvos and Kos. In Greece, it is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 20%, and the continuing decline in suitable habitat in European Türkiye suggests that it could be in decline there too. On this basis, the Syrian Spadefoot is precautionarily listed as Near Threatened under criterion A for the Europe region.  It is assessed as Endangered under criterion B (B2ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v)) for the EU 27 region as its area of occupancy in Greece is 60 km², it is considered to be severely fragmented, and the habitat area, extent and quality, number of subpopulations and number of mature individuals are undergoing continuing decline.",English,Endangered (EN),"B2ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v)",,EU27 (post 2020),"No change,-1,3,3",This is a restricted concept of this species following the split of the broader concept into this species (which as now defined contains the subspecies Pelobates syriacus syriacus and P. s. boettgeri) and Pelobates balcanicus (Dufresnes et al. 2019).,"Cogălniceanu, D., Crnobrnja-Isailović, J., Lymberakis, P., Wilkinson, J., Strachinis, I. & Üzüm, N.","Corti, C., Crochet, P.-A., Dujsebayeva, T., Ficetola, F., Halpern, B., Jablonski, D., Kirschey, T., Litvinchuk, S., Manenti, R., Martinez Solano, I., Mueldner, L., Poboljšaj, K., Razzetti, E., Romano, A., Salvi, D., Schmidt, B.R., Schulte, U., Speybroeck, J., Stănescu, F. & Vignoli, L.","Agasyan, A., Ananjeva, N.B., Andrén, C., Gafny, S., Kaya, U., Najafi-Majd, E., Orlov, N.L., Podloucky, R., Safaei Mahroo, B., Tuniyev, B. & Tuniyev, S."
