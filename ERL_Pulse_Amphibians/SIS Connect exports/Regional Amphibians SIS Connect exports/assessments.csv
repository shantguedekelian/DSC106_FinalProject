In some parts of its range, it avoids ponds inside forests. It seems that higher amounts of deciduous forest and pasture, together with proximity to deciduous forest seem to be positive for the presence of Great Crested Newts, while coniferous forest and mire appear to have a negative effect on the habitat quality for the species (Gustafson <em>et al</em>. 2011). Reproduction takes place in permanent stagnant and in semi-flowing waters such as ponds, rarely lakes, flooded quarries, irrigation channels and ditches. The usage of small ponds is typical across the range. It can be found in modified habitat types, but this species is not considered to be very adaptable. Drainage ditches can represent important aquatic habitats for this species, which needs to be considered in restoration activities (Hartel <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>Connectivity at multiple scales is essential for the preservation with a high density of ponds favouring its presence in aquatic habitats (Denoël <em>et al</em>. 2013). In pond networks, a large part of populations is not site faithful, dispersing between ponds within and among breeding seasons, also suggesting the importance of connectivity (Denoël <em>et al</em>. 2018). The importance of habitat features at a close range to ponds has been highlighted both for the use of aquatic habitats and genetic richness (Denoël <em>et al</em>. 2013; Cox <em>et al</em>. 2021). Introduced fish <em>Perccottus glenii</em> strongly prey on tadpoles of this species causing a strong decline in the number of local populations in Russia (Reshetnikov 2001).",English,Done,"Although the species is known to be declining or rare in parts of its distribution (Denoël 2012), it appears to remain relatively common in suitable habitats in some other parts of its range. However, population sizes are small in several parts of the range, particularly in geographic areas where declines have been highlighted (Denoël <em>et al.</em> 2013). Improved fiеld methods (aquatic funnel traps) of recent years can mask declines in the species.

Correspondingly, industrial pollution of water, destruction and drainage of ponds seem to be negative factors for <em>T. cristatus</em>.<br/><br/>Polluted waters have been reported to impact negatively its occurrence in agricultural ponds (Denoël <em>et al</em>. 2013). Lack of connectivity among breeding sites, and the presence of introduced fish also threaten the survival of local crested newts (Denoel <em>et al</em>. 2013). The impact of natural factors such as ponds overgrowing, shallowing and eutrophication is harmful to urban populations and those near to the range margins.<br/><br/>Being recognised also as a species which uses lotic habitats, it was considered as potentially threatened by the establishment of run-of-river small hydropower plants in the part of the Carpathian region which enters the Balkan Peninsula (Crnobrnja-Isailović <em>et al</em>. 2021). Introduced predatory fishes are leading to declines in some areas. Contemporary agricultural practices (e.g. glyphosate application on the arable fields) coincide with species seasonal migrations (Berger <em>et al</em>. 2013). In some parts of the range (of the former Soviet Union), there is substantial commercial collecting of this species for the pet trade. Habitat fragmentation is a threat.

It exploits a variety of habitats across that range including woodlands, shrublands, heathlands, dunes and more arid areas, as well as anthropogenically modified habitats such as farmland and gardens. In the north of its range (Jersey), it breeds commonly in small, still ponds of anthropogenic origin, as well as temporary (e.g. dune slack) ponds (Wilkinson <em>et al</em>. 2007), but exhibits broader habitat preferences further south, also breeding in more permanent water bodies including streams and stream pools (Iberia) (Da Fonseca <em>et al</em>. 2008, Gómez-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2009, Ben Hassine and Escoriza 2014). In southern France, it is known from a broad range of natural and artificial breeding sites, although it does not tolerate salinity and is absent from coastal habitats (Geniez and Cheylan 2012; P.A.

In the Greek East Aegean, the species occurs at the northeast part of Lemnos Island (Dufresnes <em>et al.</em> 2019), on the northwest side of Lesvos Island and in one location on Kos Island (Strachinis and Roussos 2016, Dufresnes <em>et al</em>. 2019; I. Strachinis pers. comm. November 2022). Its presence in Bulgaria requires confirmation so is not included in this assessment, and its possible range there is included as 'Presence Uncertain' in the map.<br/><br/>The species has an extensive range out of the European region, extending through Anatolia (Türkiye) to the Caucuses and northern Iran, and south through western Syria to Lebanon (Hasbani Valley and in the Bekaa Valley near the Aammiq marsh), Israel and the West Bank of Palestine. The species is probably extinct in Jordan where it has not been observed since 1984; Disi <em>et al.</em> (2014) consider that it had become extinct in Jordan in the last thirty years following the loss of its last known locality. Records from northern Iraq require confirmation. At the global scale, the species occurs from 26 m below sea level (Cham-Kaleh Seashore, Gilan Province, Iran (Safaei-Mahroo and Ghaffari 2020) to above 2,000 m asl.",21/02/2023,LC,,3.1,,TRUE,NT,,A2ac,FALSE,FALSE,,"European regional assessment: Near Threatened (NT)<br/>EU 27 regional assessment: Endangered (EN)<br/><br/>In Europe, this species is restricted to a small number of records from the European part of Türkiye and on three Greek islands - Lemnos, Lesvos and Kos. In Greece, it is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 20%, and the continuing decline in suitable habitat in European Türkiye suggests that it could be in decline there too. On this basis, the Syrian Spadefoot is precautionarily listed as Near Threatened under criterion A for the Europe region.<br/><br/>It is assessed as Endangered under criterion B (B2ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v)) for the EU 27 region as its area of occupancy in Greece is 60 km², it is considered to be severely fragmented, and the habitat area, extent and quality, number of subpopulations and number of mature individuals are undergoing continuing decline.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"The species is generally threatened by habitat destruction through drainage or loss of breeding wetlands and conversion of land to agricultural and industrial use, and related water pollution but the scale and impact of these threats in European Türkiye are not known.<br/><br/>In European Türkiye, forested and semi-natural areas have been destroyed over the years, particularly due to the expansion of artificial areas, which continue to increase. The Ergene River basin is the most important aquatic habitat in the Thrace region and is intensively exposed to agricultural, domestic and industrial pollution (Tokatlı and Atılgan Helvacıoğlu 2020).<br/><br/>There is high negative impact of tourism development on suitable habitats of this species in the Greek part of its range, and it is very vulnerable to land alterations and pollution (I. Strachinis pers. comm. November 2022).<br/><br/>Climate change is having a significant impact on wetlands in the region, and this may impact the species (Cohen <em>et al.</em> 2021).",There are no records of this species being utilised.,223143581,172313717,Pelobates syriacus
