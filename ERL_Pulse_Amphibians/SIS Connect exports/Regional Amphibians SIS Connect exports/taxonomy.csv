58548,"The intraspecific systematics of this species needs further study. Animals from the Altai Mountains have for a long time been considered as a separate subspecies of <em>Rana arvalis</em> or as the species <em>Rana altaica</em>. This has largely been on the basis of their shorter shins and large inner metatarsal tubercle. Similar frogs have since been found in other parts of the range of <em>Rana arvalis</em> (e.g., in the north of European Russia and in the Urals) and in Siberia some animals display transient characters between <em>Rana arvalis</em> and the Altaic taxon.

58705,"Investigations of mitochondrial DNA suggest that subpopulations from the southern Caucasus and Central Asia might represent separate species. The taxonomy of Anatolian water frogs (including this species) is still unclear; some authors suggest that the presence of this species in Türkiye cannot be established on the basis of morphometric data.<br/><br/>There are studies that claim that this species represents a species complex and therefore are questioning the identity of marsh frogs e.g. from western Caucasus area (Ermakov <em>et al</em>. 2016).

58707,"Prior to Uzzell (1982) (who provisionally resurrected the name), this species was considered to be a synonym of <em>Pelophylax perezi</em>, or, following Pasteur and Bons (1959), a synonym of <em>P. ridibundus</em>. Although northwest African members of the ""<em>P. esculentus</em>"" complex are here tentatively regarded as <em>P. saharicus</em>, Hemmer, Konrad and Bachmann (1980), suggested that two species were hybridizing in North Africa. Steinwarz and Schneider (1991), considered it probable that <em>P. saharicus</em> is a junior synonym of <em>P. perezi</em>.<br/><br/>Cryptic diversity possibly exists in the Libyan subpopulation (Ibrahim 2013). Nicolas et al. (2014) found their sampled populations from Morocco and Algeria to be genetically distinct, suggesting divergence along the Moulouya River valley dating back approximately 2.6 Mya. Some mitochondrial differentiation has been found between northern and southern populations in Morocco (Lansari <em>et al. </em>2015). Arano<em> et al</em>.
