It inhabits subterranean karstic habitats up to 1500 m vertical depth (dry cave systems with water streams at the bottom) and up to -113 depth of water column, withstanding water pressure of up to 12 atmospheres (<a>Kovač-Konrad and Koller 2017)</a>. Many of the caves that the species occurs in are connected to rivers that run above ground for the first 50–100 km and then disappear into the ground. Subpopulations may be found close to the surface or as much as 300 m underground depending on the thickness of the karstic formation. It may also be found at cave entrances or washed-out of caves after episodes of high rainfall and flooding (Aljančič <em>et al.</em> 2014b).<br/><br/>The water temperature of the habitat ranges from about 5°C to 15°C, which is also the approximate extent of annual fluctuations. <em>Proteus anguinus parkelj</em> is found in warmer surface waters and some subpopulations of the nominal subspecies were found in such conditions as well. Animals feed on detritus and endemic cave invertebrates and hide in crevices or bottom sediment when disturbed, and are well adapted to cave life (e.g. Briegleb 1962, Aljančič <em>et al</em>. 1993, Bulog 2006, Balázs <em>et al</em>. 2015, Zakšek <em>et al.</em> 2017, Gorički <em>et al</em>. 2019). As it is very difficult to study the species in its natural subterranean habitat, most ecological data comes from cave laboratories (Briegleb 1962, Parzefall <em>et al</em>. 1980, Hervant <em>et al</em>. 2000). In captivity, they become sexually mature at 15 years of age and reproduce on average only every 12 years, while their lifespan can exceed 100 years (Voituron <em>et al</em>. 2011).

A study by Vörös <em>et al.</em> (2019) of four cave systems in Croatia showed the highest population density of 7–11.45 individuals/10 m<sup>2</sup> of cave, and the lowest of 0.45–1.08 individuals/10 m<sup>2</sup> of cave.<br/><br/>A decline in the number of sites and individuals has been reported for the subpopulations of Goriza (Italy), Potojna (Slovenia) (Gasc <em>et al</em>. 1997), Dolenjska and Bela Krajina (Slovenia) (Hudoklin 2011) and Croatia (Jelić <em>et al</em>. 2012).

Past ecological incidents are still a considerable source of pollution; high accumulation of heavy metals and PCB were detected in tissues of selected subpopulations in Slovenia (Bulog <em>et al</em>. 2002, Pezdirc <em>et al</em>. 2011). Destruction of habitat, such as extensive hydrotechnical works for hydroelectric power stations remains a particularly severe threat in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Čučković 1983, Lewarne 1999) and in Croatia (Jelić <em>et al</em>. 2012). Considerable threat comes from changes to the forested and pastoral land above the subterranean cave systems, including intensive agriculture - excessive groundwater pumping for irrigation in agriculture, salinisation of karst springs and fish farming (Ozimec 2011, Aljančič <em>et al</em>. 2014a). These changes have a direct influence on the quality and extent of the groundwater habitat, which also represents the only reliable source of drinking water in the karst for the Western Balkans. Significant threats to this species could also arise through tourism – especially sport diving in the caves (see in Balázs and Lewarne 2017). The species is highly dependent on clean water, and local subpopulations in the wild are therefore very susceptible to pollution and fungal infections other than <em>Bsal</em> (e.g. Lukac <em>et al</em>. 2015, Bizjak-Mali <em>et al.</em> 2018). Additionally, climate change is expected to dramatically increase the timing, frequency and magnitude of periodical floods, and the ability of <em>Proteus </em>to cope with environmental changes will be apparently reduced (Aljančič <em>et al</em>. 2014). There is some occasional illegal collection of the species for the pet trade.<br/>In Italy and Slovenia, introduced freshwater species may present major threat in the future.<br/><br/><em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em> (<em>Bsal</em>) is an emerging fungal pathogen affecting amphibians and is closely related to <em>B. dendrobatidis</em> (<em>Bd</em>), which has had a devastating impact on amphibian populations around the world. Both pathogens cause the infectious disease chytridiomycosis, and both are believed to have originated in Asia (for <em>Bsal</em>: Martel <em>et al.</em> 2014, for <em>Bd</em>: O'Hanlon <em>et al.</em> 2018). While <em>Bd</em> can cause disease in frogs, salamanders and caecilians, <em>Bsal</em> has only been reported to cause disease in salamanders and newts, although the pathogen has been detected in some frog species (Martel <em>et al.</em> 2013). <em>Bd</em> has spread globally, but at present <em>Bsal</em> is only known in Asia and has been introduced to Europe, most likely through the pet trade in salamanders (Martel <em>et al.</em> 2014, Nguyen <em>et al.</em> 2017). Currently in Europe, <em>Bsal</em> has been detected in the wild in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany (e.g. Thein <em>et al</em>. 2020) and Spain (Martel <em>et al</em>. 2020), and has been shown to be highly pathogenic to most urodelan taxa in Europe (Martel <em>et al.</em> 2014). Laboratory trials for susceptibility to <em>Bsal</em> demonstrate low-level infection and subsequent disease for this species (Gilbert <em>et al.</em> 2020, F. Pasmans and A. Martel pers. comm. June 2021). It is thought that wild subpopulations would have some resistance to <em>Bsal</em> and it is not considered to be a major threat. Extinction risk modeling demonstrates that this species will not be at significant risk from the natural spread of the fungus in the next 50 years.","There are some anecdotes about this species being found in the pet trade, but it is not considered a major threat.",227229041,18377,Proteus anguinus

It can be found in ponds and lakes as well as in modified habitats such as quarries and artificial water bodies such as stony wells, tanks (water reservoirs) and drinking troughs (Denoël 2004). However, not all water bodies within an area are suitable for this species: only three of nine small water bodies regularly monitored since 2017 at Vlasina plateau in Southeastern Serbia harbour this species (Crnobrnja-Isailović, unpublished data). Adults are presumed to be relatively more aquatic than <em>Triturus ivanbureschi</em> (Wielstra and Arntzen 2011). Its breeding and larval development takes place in various stagnant, preferably permanent or long standing, temporary aquatic habitats.",English,Done,"Some subpopulations are still large, but they are generally declining throughout the range.

Aquatic habitats used for breeding and larval development include temporary or permanent ponds, abandoned quarries and wells, drinking troughs, irrigation ponds, ditches and other areas of stagnant or slow-moving water with aquatic vegetation. It is found in traditional farmland areas and other slightly modified habitats. Egg laying behaviour of females includes the protection of each egg by wrapping them into folded leaves of aquatic plants. Therefore, the presence of aquatic submerged vegetation in breeding ponds is essential for successful reproduction.<br/><br/>Its generation length is estimated to be around three years, which is based on the various reproductive and longevity data that exist for both the Spanish and Portuguese subpopulations of this species (e.g. Diaz-Paniagua 1986, Caetano 1990, Caetano and Castanet 1993, Díaz-Paniagua <em>et al.</em> 1996).",English,Done,"It is common in areas where suitable siliceous substrate habitat exists.

In the west of Spain and southern Portugal populations are affected by predation and competition by non-native crayfish and fish. Increasing urbanisation surrounding Madrid has also led to the elimination of many subpopulations. This is extensible to several areas of Andalusia (I. Martínez-Solano pers. comm. November 2019). In southern and eastern Spain, over-exploitation of groundwater resources, agrochemical pollution, loss of traditional breeding sites and the introduction of predatory non-native fish and crayfish (<em>Procambarus clarkii</em>) has led to a serious population decline. In Portugal this species is also affected by the drainage of temporary ponds, associated with the intensification of agriculture. In southern and western Spain, the alteration and destruction of the reproductive areas of this newt have been very pronounced in recent decades (R. Reques and I. Martínez-Solano pers. comm.

The limited dispersal abilities and long larval period makes this species vulnerable to both terrestrial habitat degradation and fragmentation and degradation of aquatic habitats. Thus, the main threat is habitat alteration due to expanding agriculture, urban and industrial zones. Severe fragmentation of its habitats due to extensive agriculture and urbanisation is already reflected in its patchy distribution and might ultimately lead to local population isolation and decline. Since the aquatic stage is long the quality of the breeding ponds is essential for its reproductive success. Pollution of the breeding ponds can pose a serious threat to reproductive success and juvenile fitness. The main source of pollution is modern intensive agriculture, with heavy loads of pesticides and fertilisers leaching into aquatic habitats or accumulating in the soil, thus affecting both the aquatic and terrestrial habitats of the species. Increased salinity from agriculture, road de-icing and sea level rise can alter the available breeding habitats and thus impact reproductive success. Road mortality due to traffic can pose a serious threat, especially during mass migration events – in the spring, when adults head towards the breeding ponds, and in summer, when juveniles disperse from the breeding ponds throughout the surrounding habitats (Stănescu <em>et al.</em> 2016). <br/><br/>Climate change is a possible future threat for this species, especially regarding the availability and duration of temporary ponds used for breeding and the threat of severe floods that can cause massive mortality in floodplain subpopulations.",There are no records of this species being utilised.,228186498,172312067,Pelobates balcanicus

While <em>Bd</em> can cause disease in frogs, salamanders and caecilians, <em>Bsal</em> has only been reported to cause disease in salamanders and newts, although the pathogen has been detected in some frog species (Martel <em>et al.</em> 2013). <em>Bd</em> has spread globally, but at present, <em>Bsal</em> is only known in Asia and has been introduced to Europe, most likely through the pet trade in salamanders (Martel <em>et al.</em> 2014, Nguyen <em>et al.</em> 2017). Currently in Europe, <em>Bsal</em> has been detected in the wild in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany (e.g. Thein <em>et al</em>. 2020) and Spain (Martel <em>et al</em>. 2020), and has been shown to be highly pathogenic to most urodelan taxa in Europe (Martel <em>et al.</em> 2014). Laboratory trials for susceptibility to <em>Bsal</em> demonstrate susceptibility to the disease for this species, with mortality observed in those individuals tested (F. Pasmans and A. Martel pers. comm. June 2021). On a precautionary basis, it is thought that it is unlikely that wild subpopulations would have much resistance to <em>Bsal </em>and it is considered to be a possible threat to this species. There are no current records of <em>Bsal</em> within this species range, however, it should be monitored if an outbreak occurs. Based on current distribution data for <em>Bsal</em>, it is expected that the natural advancement of the infection could be between 10–20 km per year. Due to the proximity of its range to multiple <em>Bsal</em> outbreaks, modelling (see attached Supplementary Information) has found this species to be at significant risk from <em>Bsal</em> in the next 15–30 years (which represents three generations). However, this does not take into account further human-induced introduction of the disease and should new outbreaks occur within this species’ range then it will need to be reassessed as soon as possible.","The species is occasionally used as bait by fishermen (A.
