18377,"The currently accepted taxonomy recognizes two subspecies: the whitish, depigmented and blind Proteus anguinus anguinus (“White Proteus”), and the dark-colored, eyed P. a. parkelj (“Black Proteus”). The subspecies P. a. parkelj was considered to be of doubtful validity (Goricki and Trontelj 2006).  The White Proteus is distributed throughout the entire range of the species, the Black Proteus is only known from a few sites in the region of Bela Krajina in southeastern Slovenia.  Recent molecular studies revealed that the species is deeply subdivided into nine lineages supported by both mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites (Gorički and Trontelj 2006, Trontelj et al. 2009, Trontelj and Zakšek 2016, Vörös et al. 2019). The Black Proteus constitutes one of those lineages. Their ranges are mostly allopatric, although they are touching or even overlapping in some areas (Gorički et al. 2017).  The assessment of the exact taxonomic and conservation status of the Proteus lineages is the subject of ongoing research (Bizjak Mali and Sket 2019), but they should be treated as evolutionary significant units, to ensure the survival of diversity in this threatened species.",AMPHIBIA,PROTEIDAE,Proteus,,,,18377,Proteus anguinus,ANIMALIA,CAUDATA,CHORDATA,anguinus,"Laurenti, 1768"

S. a. prenjensis is often not considered to be valid. S. a. aurorae has been sometimes considered to be a separate species. Joger (1996), using serum proteins, showed significant differences, and he proposed the elevation of S. a. aurorae to a full species. Veith et al. (1998), analyzing mitDNA of S. a. aurorae did not find any significant difference. Riberon et al.

The species status of P. kurtmuelleri is controversial (Speybroeck et al. 2010, 2020), mostly due to its low mtDNA divergence and shared interspecific polymorphism with P. ridibundus (e.g., Lymberakis et al. 2007, Akin et al. 2010, Plötner et al. 2012, Hofman et al. 2015, Litvinchuk et al. 2020) and weak morphometric differentiation (Papežík et al. 2021).
