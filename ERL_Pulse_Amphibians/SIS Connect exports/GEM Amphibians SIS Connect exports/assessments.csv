Palearctic,"<strong>Conservation Actions In-Place</strong><br/>The species is protected by sub-national and national legislation. It is listed on Appendix II of the Berne Convention, on Annexes II and IV of the EU Natural Habitats Directive, and on the national and sub-national Red Data Books. It is present in the protected areas of the Tramuntana Mountains.<br/><br/>The Balearic Government and the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust have undertaken captive-breeding, re-introduction and other conservation initiatives. At least ten subpopulations have been successfully reintroduced. Reintroductions of animals from the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust stopped in 2002, but a new captive-breeding facility now exists on Mallorca, and reintroductions continue. However, as a result of the recent discovery of disease, a recommendation was made in 2004 to the Balearic Government to halt the reintroduction programme. A new recovery programme for the species is now being developed. A systematic programme is in place to remove <em>Natrix maura</em> from the range of the species.&#160;Successful mitigation of chytridiomycosis took place after thousands of tadpoles were treated with fungicide in the laboratory and chemicals were applied into the environment (J. Bosch pers. comm. November 2019).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Needed</strong><br/>The threats are not likely to decrease, and so the current recovery programme needs to be continued more or less indefinitely. Recreational activities are not adequately regulated or controlled (Á. Román pers. comm. November 2019), thus this could be improved to benefit the conservation of the species.<br/><br/><strong>Research Needed<br/></strong>There is a need for continual population monitoring of this species given the threats of invasive species and disease. An action plan for its recovery and management is needed.","This species is currently found only in small streams deeply carved into limestone mountains. The presence of the species is positively associated with steep slopes. A few subpopulations occur by man-made water sources (cattle troughs, containers, rain tanks etc.) in open mountainous country; these are within the river basins of nearby canyon-living subpopulations. Animals are generally found in rock crevices and under stones. This species does not tolerate serious habitat degradation. The distribution of predators on the species is negatively associated with elevation, and reproductive success is positively associated with elevation.<br/><br/>Breeding takes place in the small streams that persist as pools in summer. Clutch size varies from 4-34 eggs (Pinya and Perez-Mellado 2014a). Females and males had a mean longevity of 4.70 years and 3.24 years, respectively, the maximum estimated longevity was 18 years for both sexes, males reached sexual maturity at the age of one year, and most females at two years (Pinya and Perez-Mellado 2014b). Survival was estimated as 0.737±0.042 and 0.726±0.045, for males and females, respectively (Pinya <em>et al</em>. 2017).",English,Done,"The population is approximately 500-1,500 adult pairs (Gasc <em>et al.</em> 1997, Arnold 2003), however, the total population is slowly increasing following coordinated recovery efforts (establishment of reintroduced subpopulations) following a long period of decline and near extinction. Subpopulations are fragmented with low levels of gene flow (J. Bosch pers. comm. November 2019). There are approximately 25, mostly isolated, subpopulations. The current increase, which probably started around the time that the first reintroductions were made in 1989, has been maintained even during years of drought, notably in 1999-2000.<br/><br/>The population trend in this species is monitored through annual tadpole counts, the counts for 2004 (over 30,000 tadpoles) being the highest on record. The increase in numbers in established subpopulations is not dependent upon continued reintroductions. In general, the reintroduced subpopulations are successfully reproducing, although some receive new animals from time to time to reinforce them (J. Bosch pers. comm. November 2022). It is unlikely that new subpopulations would be established without reintroductions.",Increasing,"This species is restricted to the Sierra Tramuntana of northern Mallorca, Balearic Islands, Spain, between 10-850 m asl (Doddington <em>et al.</em> 2013).

There have been increased introductions of the Viperine Snake in Mallorca, and there have been 90% larval population declines observed in some sites (S. Pinya and Á. Román pers. comm. April 2020). Development of tourism and human settlements, specifically the increased need for water resources (including damming and canalisation of streams), is an additional threat, as is high human pressure on karstic creeks for recreational purposes, with the potential for the spread of disease agents (Á. Román pers. comm. November 2019). Chytridiomycosis was introduced in Mallorca through captive-bred individuals of this species, and it is considered to be a major threat (Bosch <em>et al. </em>2015; J. Bosch pers. comm.

Populations are currently in regression, with larvae abundances similar to 15 years ago (Cortes-Fernandez 2018).<br/><br/>Another problem is the lack of maintenance for newly created breeding habitats so, while this species has been reported from an increased number of new localities, the subpopulations are not persisting there over time (S.

The species is also collected for the international pet trade (Frank <em>et al.</em> 2018). An additional threat could be the accidental introduction of the commercially transported non-native water frog <em>Aquarana catesbeianus</em>, which may be competing with this species (J. Crnobrnja-Isailović&#160;pers. comm. September 2019). The species is collected for the food industry and by local people, even during the breeding season, for consumption in restaurants (Haxhiu 2015, Saçdanaku <em>et al</em>. 2020; D. Jablonski and E. Mizsei pers. obs.).<br/><br/>Albania represents the main distribution area for this endemic species. This species is distributed in a small range with a size of ~ 5,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Jablonski <em>et al.</em> 2021) and most of the species' range is limited to populated coastal areas where massive development has occurred in the past years and the species might be threatened mainly by fragmentation and degradation of habitats. Moreover, the area is also the main agricultural region of Albania, and drainage, chemical, and waste pollution are important factors that will decrease the population of <em>P. shqipericus</em> (Haxhiu 2015, Saçdanaku <em>et al</em>. 2020, Crnobrnja-Isailović <em>et al</em>. 2022).","This species is over-harvested for human consumption for both national and international purposes, and also collected for the international pet trade (Altherr <em>et al. </em>2022).",207982996,58715,Pelophylax shqipericus

Its terrestrial habitats are generally restricted to riverine scrub or woodland, and the species may also be found in cave systems. Its breeding sites are permanent pools, water holes, small lakes and streams. The eggs are deposited between stones or are buried in sand; the larvae develop in the streams (Griffiths 1996, Rimpp 1998). The species is quite adaptable and can be found in artificial pools.",English,Done,"This is generally a rare species that can be locally common in suitable habitat (e.g. over 400 specimens may be found in a single pool). The largest subpopulation is in the Gola di Gorropu (eastern-central Sardinia). In one well-studied population, the sex ratio is largely male.<br/><br/>The number of subpopulations is in decline (Rondinini <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2022; NGO Zirichiltaggi Sardinia Wildlife Conservation 2022), and the recent increase of threats (from diseases and alien species) is causing a reduction in newt abundance, especially in small and suboptimal subpopulations (G. Tessa pers. comm. September 2019). The number of subpopulations was reported to be declining in 2008. Between 1999 and 2001 it was found in 14 sites, whereas previously around 1991 it was present in 30 sites (and even in 1991 it was absent from nine other sites where it had been previously observed). Sotgiu<em> et al.</em> (2010) and Vignoli <em>et al.</em> (2016) reported a number of subpopulations comparable with the subpopulations found by Alcher in the 1970s (Alcher 1975). Declines are thought to have occurred in the last 10 years due to the introduction of fish to streams and rivers, where this species occurs (Vignoli <em>et al.</em> 2016). A study on a recently detected new invasive crayfish species (<em>Procambarus virginalis</em> Lyko, 2017) in the freshwaters of Sardinia (Sanna <em>et al.</em> 2021) strongly supports the statement of conservationists that the rate of decline of the population of Sardinian Brook Salamander is increasing.

During the 1950s, many subpopulations were lost through the application of DDT to waterbodies. The Gola di Gorroppu subpopulation and other streams in north and central Sardinia have become threatened through damage to its habitat caused by tourist activities, particularly hiking within the streams (C.

Additional threats include <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis </em>(<em>Bd</em>) with outbreaks detected from the north to the south of the island (Bovero <em>et al.</em> 2008, Bielby <em>et al</em>. 2013, Tessa <em>et al.</em> 2023), and the presence of the alien species of Green Frogs and the Red Swamp Crayfish <em>Procambarus clarkii </em>(Souty-Grosset <em>et al</em>. 2016, Oficialdegui <em>et al</em>. 2019; G.

The species is collected for the pet trade, which is thought to be slightly affecting the population.<br/><br/><em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans </em>(<em>Bsal</em>) is an emerging fungal pathogen affecting amphibians and is closely related to <em>B. dendrobatidis</em> (<em>Bd</em>), which has had a devastating impact on amphibian populations around the world. Both pathogens cause the infectious disease chytridiomycosis, and both are believed to have originated in Asia (for <em>Bsal</em>: Martel <em>et al.</em> 2014, for <em>Bd</em>: O'Hanlon <em>et al.</em> 2018). While <em>Bd</em> can cause disease in frogs, salamanders and caecilians, <em>Bsal</em> has only been reported to cause disease in salamanders and newts, although the pathogen has been detected in some frog species (Martel <em>et al.</em> 2013). <em>Bd</em> has spread globally, but at present, <em>Bsal</em> is only known in Asia and has been introduced to Europe, most likely through the pet trade in salamanders (Martel <em>et al.</em> 2014, Nguyen <em>et al.</em> 2017). Currently in Europe, <em>Bsal</em> has been detected in the wild in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany (e.g. Thein <em>et al</em>. 2020) and Spain (Martel <em>et al</em>. 2020), and has been shown to be highly pathogenic to most urodelan taxa in Europe (Martel <em>et al.</em> 2014). Laboratory trials for susceptibility to <em>Bsal</em> found this species to be highly susceptible to the disease (Gilbert <em>et al.</em> 2020, A. Martels and F. Pasmans pers. comm. September 2021). Based on current distribution data for <em>Bsal</em>, it is expected that the natural advancement of the infection could be up to 10 km per year which would result in a conservative advancement of 400–500 km per 50 years. Extinction risk modelling demonstrates that this species would be at significant risk from the natural spread of the fungus in the next 50 years, and could be categorised under Endangered or Vulnerable under criterion E if it was found in mainland Europe. However, this is an island species and Sardinia currently has no records of <em>Bsal</em>. This does not take into consideration the human-induced introduction of the disease, and should a new outbreak occur on Sardinia then it will need to be reassessed as soon as possible as this is a very plausible future threat.",This species is found in the pet trade; collection from the wild for trade is thought to be slightly affecting the population (G.

It is not often found in modified habitats.",English,Done,"Although not necessarily abundant, this species is more common in southern areas, including the Basilicata and Calabrian mountains, and it is considered to be rare in central Italy, especially around the Italian Apennines. Declines have been observed in Calabria, Puglia and Abruzzo Mountains, especially in agricultural areas (C. Liuzzi pers. comm. September 2019). Due to ongoing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat, the population is inferred to be decreasing.",Decreasing,"This species is found through most of central and southern Italy, with higher concentrations at lower elevations. It has been recorded up to 1,750 m asl (C. Liuzzi pers. comm. September 2019).",21/02/2023,LC,,3.1,,TRUE,LC,,,FALSE,FALSE,,"The Italian Newt (<em>Lissotriton italicus</em>) is a European endemic species that is restricted to southern peninsula Italy. It is assessed as Least Concern in view of its relatively wide distribution, presumed large population, and because it is unlikely to be declining fast enough for listing in a threatened category.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"The main threats to the species are localised drainage of wetlands, the pollution and eutrophication of aquatic habitats (especially breeding ponds) which is caused by agriculture, and the introduction of predatory fishes.<br/><br/><em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em> (<em>Bsal</em>) is an emerging fungal pathogen affecting amphibians and is closely related to <em>B. dendrobatidis</em> (<em>Bd</em>), which has had a devastating impact on amphibian populations around the world. Both pathogens cause the infectious disease chytridiomycosis, and both are believed to have originated in Asia (for <em>Bsal</em>: Martel <em>et al.</em> 2014, for <em>Bd</em>: O'Hanlon <em>et al.</em> 2018). While <em>Bd </em>can cause disease in frogs, salamanders and caecilians, <em>Bsal </em>has only been reported to cause disease in salamanders and newts, although the pathogen has been detected in some frog species (Martel <em>et al.</em> 2013). <em>Bd </em>has spread globally, but at present <em>Bsal </em>is only known in Asia and has been introduced to Europe, most likely through the pet trade in salamanders (Martel <em>et al.</em> 2014, Nguyen <em>et al. </em>2017). Currently in Europe, <em>Bsal </em>has been detected in the wild in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany (e.g. Thein<em> et al</em>. 2020) and Spain (Martel <em>et al</em>. 2020), and has been shown to be highly pathogenic to most urodelan taxa in Europe (Martel <em>et al.</em> 2014). Laboratory trials for susceptibility to <em>Bsal</em> are uncertain with regard to adult susceptibility to the disease. Only juveniles have been tested, but 100% mortality was observed (F. Pasmans and A. Martel pers. comm. June 2021). While there is no <em>Bsal</em> currently known to be present within its range, it could be considered a potential threat to this species, on a precautionary basis, and it may need to be reassessed if the fungus is detected closer.",There are no records of this species being utilised.,229006043,59476,Lissotriton italicus
