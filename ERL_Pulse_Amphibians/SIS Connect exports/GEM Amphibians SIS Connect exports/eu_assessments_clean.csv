977,Alytes muletensis,207979274,"This species is restricted to the Sierra Tramuntana of northern Mallorca, Balearic Islands, Spain, between 10-850 m asl (Doddington et al. 2013). Its area of occupancy (AOO) including successful reintroduction sites is uncertain but probably great than 50 km2 but certainly much less than 500 km2 (Doddington et al. 2013; J. Bosch pers. comm. November 2019, 2022). The AOO is slowly increasing as a result of intensive conservation action, including reintroduction sites. It occurs in fewer than five threat-defined but more than one threat-defined locations, and its extent of occurrence (EOO) is 519 km2.",Done,Palearctic,"The population is approximately 500-1,500 adult pairs (Gasc et al. 1997, Arnold 2003), however, the total population is slowly increasing following coordinated recovery efforts (establishment of reintroduced subpopulations) following a long period of decline and near extinction. Subpopulations are fragmented with low levels of gene flow (J. Bosch pers. comm. November 2019). There are approximately 25, mostly isolated, subpopulations. The current increase, which probably started around the time that the first reintroductions were made in 1989, has been maintained even during years of drought, notably in 1999-2000.  The population trend in this species is monitored through annual tadpole counts, the counts for 2004 (over 30,000 tadpoles) being the highest on record. The increase in numbers in established subpopulations is not dependent upon continued reintroductions. In general, the reintroduced subpopulations are successfully reproducing, although some receive new animals from time to time to reinforce them (J. Bosch pers. comm. November 2022). It is unlikely that new subpopulations would be established without reintroductions.",Increasing,"This species is currently found only in small streams deeply carved into limestone mountains. The presence of the species is positively associated with steep slopes. A few subpopulations occur by man-made water sources (cattle troughs, containers, rain tanks etc.) in open mountainous country; these are within the river basins of nearby canyon-living subpopulations. Animals are generally found in rock crevices and under stones. This species does not tolerate serious habitat degradation. The distribution of predators on the species is negatively associated with elevation, and reproductive success is positively associated with elevation.  Breeding takes place in the small streams that persist as pools in summer. Clutch size varies from 4-34 eggs (Pinya and Perez-Mellado 2014a). Females and males had a mean longevity of 4.70 years and 3.24 years, respectively, the maximum estimated longevity was 18 years for both sexes, males reached sexual maturity at the age of one year, and most females at two years (Pinya and Perez-Mellado 2014b). Survival was estimated as 0.737±0.042 and 0.726±0.045, for males and females, respectively (Pinya et al. 2017).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),There are no records of this species being utilised.,"The major threats to this species are predation by the introduced Viperine Snake (Natrix maura), and competition for space with the introduced Perez's Frog (Rana perezi). There have been increased introductions of the Viperine Snake in Mallorca, and there have been 90% larval population declines observed in some sites (S. Pinya and Á. Román pers. comm. April 2020). Development of tourism and human settlements, specifically the increased need for water resources (including damming and canalisation of streams), is an additional threat, as is high human pressure on karstic creeks for recreational purposes, with the potential for the spread of disease agents (Á. Román pers. comm. November 2019). Chytridiomycosis was introduced in Mallorca through captive-bred individuals of this species, and it is considered to be a major threat (Bosch et al. 2015; J. Bosch pers. comm. November 2019), although the prevalence of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has declined since the 2008 assessment (S. Pinya and Á. Román pers. comm. April 2020).  Captive-bred individuals are still being released, which poses the risk of introducing new diseases in wild subpopulations (Á. Román pers. comm. November 2019). Populations are currently in regression, with larvae abundances similar to 15 years ago (Cortes-Fernandez 2018).  Another problem is the lack of maintenance for newly created breeding habitats so, while this species has been reported from an increased number of new localities, the subpopulations are not persisting there over time (S. Pinya and Á. Román pers. comm. April 2020).","Conservation Actions In-Place The species is protected by sub-national and national legislation. It is listed on Appendix II of the Berne Convention, on Annexes II and IV of the EU Natural Habitats Directive, and on the national and sub-national Red Data Books. It is present in the protected areas of the Tramuntana Mountains.  The Balearic Government and the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust have undertaken captive-breeding, re-introduction and other conservation initiatives. At least ten subpopulations have been successfully reintroduced. Reintroductions of animals from the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust stopped in 2002, but a new captive-breeding facility now exists on Mallorca, and reintroductions continue. However, as a result of the recent discovery of disease, a recommendation was made in 2004 to the Balearic Government to halt the reintroduction programme. A new recovery programme for the species is now being developed. A systematic programme is in place to remove Natrix maura from the range of the species.&nbsp;Successful mitigation of chytridiomycosis took place after thousands of tadpoles were treated with fungicide in the laboratory and chemicals were applied into the environment (J. Bosch pers. comm. November 2019).  Conservation Needed The threats are not likely to decrease, and so the current recovery programme needs to be continued more or less indefinitely. Recreational activities are not adequately regulated or controlled (Á. Román pers. comm. November 2019), thus this could be improved to benefit the conservation of the species.

The species was introduced into one locality of continental France (Bouches-du-Rhône Department, Provence) from Corsica (R. Duguet pers. comm. March 2020; not mapped). It has been recorded at elevations from sea level up to 1,770 m asl (Sardinia).",Done,Palearctic,"This species is still common in suitable habitats in both Sardinia and Corsica.

Subpopulations on Port-Cros dramatically declined, at least since 2008, however, it is still being recorded there (R. Duguet pers. comm. March 2020). The cause of the declines observed on Port-Cros are not fully understood but are presumed to be caused by either Wild Boar (which have been established on the island since 2007-2008), a lack of oviposition site (induced by climate change), and/or a disease (R. Duguet pers. comm. March 2020).  Chytridiomycosis has been associated with unusual mortalities at three sites in northern Sardinia (Bielby et al. 2009). On the other hand, a recent survey on Levant showed that the species is still recorded in good numbers (R. Duguet pers. comm. March 2020, confirmed during review workshop 2022). Although Vignoli et al. (2017; D. Salvi and D.

Eggs are deposited in stream pools, forest floor puddles, coastal marshes, wet meadows, drainage ditches, reservoirs, and garden ponds among others, and the larvae develop in streams.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),There are no records of this species being utilised.,"The species is still heavily threatened by environmental challenges, particularly in Sardinia, including the general loss of suitable woodland and aquatic habitats. Aquatic habitats used by this species are being lost through the damming of streams and increased water abstraction for tourism.  Chytridiomycosis and urbanisation also jeopardise this species (Bielby et al. 2009, C. Corti pers. comm. September 2019), with observed mortalities in three sites in the Limbara Mountains of northern Sardinia (D. Salvi pers. comm. Sept. 2022). However, since then, mortalities have not been observed in this species (L. Vignoli and D. Salvi pers. comm. Sept. 2022). The species was impacted by the chytrid fungus between 2006 and 2010; this led to the evaluation of VU national RL status in Italy in 2013 and recently (Rondinini et al. 2022). Ongoing analyses are showing that the species is still threatened by this pathogen (T. Kirschey pers. comm. October 2022), although overall this species does not appear to be significantly threatened by disease (D. Savi pers. comm. 2022). In France, introduced subpopulations in Var département are considered threatened and those in the Port-Cros National Park are threatened with extinction (Renet et al. 2020).  On Port-Cros and Levant one can suspect threats posed by predation by newly established Wild Boar populations and/or climate change deficit in groundwater recharge (R. Duguet pers. comm. March 2020). The introduction of Marsh Frogs (Pelophylax ridibundus) to Levant is also a potential threat to the subpopulations (R. Duguet pers. comm. March 2020). The study of Girardello et al. (2010) revealed that the distribution of D. sardus is largely determined by precipitation-related factors and in the future its overall area could shrink by one-third to one-fourth of the present one.

The main threats to this species are the general loss of wetland habitat (through drainage for urbanisation, tourism, and agricultural intensification), and water pollution. Additionally, chemical pollution from agriculture intensification could be the cause of future declines of this species in Albania (Crnobrnja-Isailović et al. 2022). Dam construction and hydro-power developments are also considered to be major threats to this species (E. Mizsel pers. comm. September 2019).

Breeding and larval development take place in these wetland habitats.",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This species is over-harvested for human consumption for both national and international purposes, and also collected for the international pet trade (Altherr et al. 2022).","The major threat is the drainage and conversion of wetland habitats and the aquatic pollution of many waterways caused by agrochemical and industrial (including mining) contamination. Massive impacts, including illegal building (houses and hotels), excavation of sand, and solid waste disposal into water sources are widespread in Ulcinj, southernmost Montenegro (Polović and Čađenović 2014). Occurrence of B. dendrobatidis in Lake Skadar is another important threatening factor for this species, although it seems that it does not have a high impact on wild populations (Vojar et al. 2017). A review of potential threats is also presented in Crnobrnja-Isailović et al. (2018).  In the northern parts of its range (e.g., Lake Skadar) this species is significantly threatened by over-collection for commercial purposes for human consumption (Gratwicke et al. 2010, Haxhiu 2015, Auliya et al. 2023). The species is also collected for the international pet trade (Frank et al. 2018). An additional threat could be the accidental introduction of the commercially transported non-native water frog Aquarana catesbeianus, which may be competing with this species (J. Crnobrnja-Isailović&nbsp;pers. comm. September 2019). The species is collected for the food industry and by local people, even during the breeding season, for consumption in restaurants (Haxhiu 2015, Saçdanaku et al. 2020; D. Jablonski and E. Mizsei pers. obs.).  Albania represents the main distribution area for this endemic species. This species is distributed in a small range with a size of ~ 5,000 km2 (Jablonski et al. 2021) and most of the species' range is limited to populated coastal areas where massive development has occurred in the past years and the species might be threatened mainly by fragmentation and degradation of habitats. Moreover, the area is also the main agricultural region of Albania, and drainage, chemical, and waste pollution are important factors that will decrease the population of P. shqipericus (Haxhiu 2015, Saçdanaku et al. 2020, Crnobrnja-Isailović et al. 2022).","Conservation Actions In Place The species is present in the Lake Skadar protected area, on the border of Montenegro and Albania and coastal areas of Albania from Skadar to Orikum.

8371,Euproctus platycephalus,223758127,"This species is endemic to Sardinia, Italy (Gasc et al. 1997, Arnold 2003), where it is mostly found in the eastern part of the island between the Limbara Mountains in the north and the Sette Fratelli Mountains in the south. There are some historical records from western Sardinia (Lecis and Norris 2003a,b; Lecis and Norris 2014; Vignoli et al. 2016), however, there are no recent records from this part of southwestern Sardinia (Corti et al. submitted 2022; G. Sotgiu pers. comm. November 2022), and it is considered possibly extinct here. Further information is needed on the range of the species in the southwest of the island; there are anecdotal records from Iglesiente (Vignoli et al. 2016), but they have not been included in this assessment until further work has been carried out to verify that they belong to this species. It is not thought to occur much more widely. It has been recorded between 50–1,800 m asl, although it is most often found between 400–800 m asl. It occurs in five or fewer threat-defined locations, its extent of occurrence (EOO) is 10,609 km2, and its confirmed area of occupancy (AOO) (Vignoli et al. 2016) is less than 500 km2 (408 km2).",Done,Palearctic,"This is generally a rare species that can be locally common in suitable habitat (e.g. over 400 specimens may be found in a single pool). The largest subpopulation is in the Gola di Gorropu (eastern-central Sardinia). In one well-studied population, the sex ratio is largely male.  The number of subpopulations is in decline (Rondinini et al. 2013, 2022; NGO Zirichiltaggi Sardinia Wildlife Conservation 2022), and the recent increase of threats (from diseases and alien species) is causing a reduction in newt abundance, especially in small and suboptimal subpopulations (G. Tessa pers. comm. September 2019). The number of subpopulations was reported to be declining in 2008. Between 1999 and 2001 it was found in 14 sites, whereas previously around 1991 it was present in 30 sites (and even in 1991 it was absent from nine other sites where it had been previously observed). Sotgiu et al. (2010) and Vignoli et al. (2016) reported a number of subpopulations comparable with the subpopulations found by Alcher in the 1970s (Alcher 1975). Declines are thought to have occurred in the last 10 years due to the introduction of fish to streams and rivers, where this species occurs (Vignoli et al. 2016). A study on a recently detected new invasive crayfish species (Procambarus virginalis Lyko, 2017) in the freshwaters of Sardinia (Sanna et al. 2021) strongly supports the statement of conservationists that the rate of decline of the population of Sardinian Brook Salamander is increasing. However, it is not clear that there is a continuing decline in the number of mature individuals (Tessa et al. 2003; V. Ferri pers. comm. 2024).  In most of the territory it is fragmented, in some places more severely (V. Ferri pers. comm. 2024), and the species is considered here to be severely fragmented.",Decreasing,"The Sardinian Brook Salamander is a montane species of permanent and temporary stagnant and running waters, that prefers calm areas of small or large rivers. Its terrestrial habitats are generally restricted to riverine scrub or woodland, and the species may also be found in cave systems. Its breeding sites are permanent pools, water holes, small lakes and streams. The eggs are deposited between stones or are buried in sand; the larvae develop in the streams (Griffiths 1996, Rimpp 1998). The species is quite adaptable and can be found in artificial pools.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),This species is found in the pet trade; collection from the wild for trade is thought to be slightly affecting the population (G. Tessa pers. comm. September 2019).,"The major threats to the species are pollution of waterbodies, habitat fragmentation, predation by introduced trout, and prolonged drought (often caused by excessive water abstraction). During the 1950s, many subpopulations were lost through the application of DDT to waterbodies. The Gola di Gorroppu subpopulation and other streams in north and central Sardinia have become threatened through damage to its habitat caused by tourist activities, particularly hiking within the streams (C. Corti pers. comm. October 2022). Additional threats include Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) with outbreaks detected from the north to the south of the island (Bovero et al. 2008, Bielby et al. 2013, Tessa et al. 2023), and the presence of the alien species of Green Frogs and the Red Swamp Crayfish Procambarus clarkii (Souty-Grosset et al. 2016, Oficialdegui et al. 2019; G. Tessa pers. comm. September 2019) and, the most recently, P. virginalis (Sanna et al. 2021). An increase in the number of alien species which have detrimental effects on local amphibian fauna (NGO Zirichiltaggi Sardinia Wildlife Conservation 2022) questions statements on the stability of subpopulations of E. platicephalus. Although already in a new dynamic balance for many decades, Natrix maura is also an important non-native predator for E. platycephalus (J. Speybroeck pers. comm. October 2022). The species is collected for the pet trade, which is thought to be slightly affecting the population.  Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) is an emerging fungal pathogen affecting amphibians and is closely related to B. dendrobatidis (Bd), which has had a devastating impact on amphibian populations around the world. Both pathogens cause the infectious disease chytridiomycosis, and both are believed to have originated in Asia (for Bsal: Martel et al. 2014, for Bd: O'Hanlon et al. 2018). While Bd can cause disease in frogs, salamanders and caecilians, Bsal has only been reported to cause disease in salamanders and newts, although the pathogen has been detected in some frog species (Martel et al. 2013). Bd has spread globally, but at present, Bsal is only known in Asia and has been introduced to Europe, most likely through the pet trade in salamanders (Martel et al. 2014, Nguyen et al. 2017). Currently in Europe, Bsal has been detected in the wild in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany (e.g. Thein et al. 2020) and Spain (Martel et al. 2020), and has been shown to be highly pathogenic to most urodelan taxa in Europe (Martel et al. 2014). Laboratory trials for susceptibility to Bsal found this species to be highly susceptible to the disease (Gilbert et al. 2020, A. Martels and F. Pasmans pers. comm. September 2021). Based on current distribution data for Bsal, it is expected that the natural advancement of the infection could be up to 10 km per year which would result in a conservative advancement of 400–500 km per 50 years. Extinction risk modelling demonstrates that this species would be at significant risk from the natural spread of the fungus in the next 50 years, and could be categorised under Endangered or Vulnerable under criterion E if it was found in mainland Europe. However, this is an island species and Sardinia currently has no records of Bsal. This does not take into consideration the human-induced introduction of the disease, and should a new outbreak occur on Sardinia then it will need to be reassessed as soon as possible as this is a very plausible future threat.","Conservation Actions In-Place This species is listed on Appendix II of the Bern Convention and on Annex IV of the EU Natural Habitats Directive. The species is protected by regional legislation (Regional Law n. 23/1998 (art. 5, c. 3)). The Gola di Gorroppu has been designated as a Site of Community Importance under the Habitats Directive. In addition, a number of subpopulations live in established and planned protected areas, including Parco Regionale Sette Fratelli, Parco Nazionale Gennargentu-Golfo di Orosei, and Parco Regionale Monte Limbara.  The development of a citizen science project is also underway to help with the monitoring of amphibian species in Italy (F. Ficetola and R. Manenti pers. comm. September 2019). Furthermore, monitoring of all Natura 2000 sites and species is ongoing in Italy, including this species (F. Ficetola and R. Manenti pers. comm. September 2019). A reintroduction project is in place, where 30 individuals born in captivity at the Fondazione Bioparco di Roma as part of a project funded and sponsored by EAZA and Amphibian ARK (Tapley et al. 2015) were reintroduced in 2019 at a location in the Sette Fratelli (CA) area where the species was known until the late 1990s (L. Vignoli pers. comm. October 2022). The reintroduced individuals reproduced in 2020. All animals were screened for known diseases (F. Ficetola pers. comm. October 2022).  Conservation Needed Programmes to monitor diseases, and remove trout and other alien species from the species' habitat would assist in the recovery of subpopulations (G. Tessa pers. comm. September 2019). There is also an urgent need for an EU (European Union) wide coordinated approach and implementation of the Bsal Action Plan by Gilbert et al. (2020), which was commissioned by the European Commission.  Research Needed If an outbreak of Bsal was to occur within this species' range, population monitoring would need to be carried out immediately and this species would need to be reassessed.

Climate change is likely to be a major threat to this species due to narrow microclimatic preferences of the genus, which will be problematic as the climate alters their distribution and activity in the future (Ficetola et al. 2020).  Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) is an emerging fungal pathogen affecting amphibians and is closely related to B. dendrobatidis (Bd), which has had a devastating impact on amphibian populations around the world. Both pathogens cause the infectious disease chytridiomycosis, and both are believed to have originated in Asia (for Bsal: Martel et al. 2014, for Bd: O'Hanlon et al. 2018). While Bd can cause disease in frogs, salamanders and caecilians, Bsal has only been reported to cause disease in salamanders and newts, although the pathogen has been detected in some frog species (Martel et al. 2013). Bd has spread globally, but at present Bsal is only known in Asia and has been introduced to Europe, most likely through the pet trade in salamanders (Martel et al. 2014, Nguyen et al. 2017). Currently in Europe, Bsal has been detected in the wild in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany (e.g. Thein et al. 2020) and Spain (Martel et al. 2020), and has been shown to be highly pathogenic to most urodelan taxa in Europe (Martel et al. 2014). This species has not been tested for its susceptibility to Bsal, however, it is presumed to be vulnerable to infection, given the susceptibility of its closely related taxa which have been tested (F.

58567,Pelophylax cerigensis,229002159,"The Karpathos Frog (Pelophylax cerigensis) was formerly considered to be restricted to Karpathos Island, Greece, but recent research based on analyses of complete mitogenomes (Toli et al. 2023) found the species to also occur on Rhodes Island. On Karpathos it has a very restricted distribution (currently found in four localities within an area of less than 10 km2), whilst on Rhodes it appears to be more widespread. It can be found from sea level up to 500 m asl (point data from herpatlas.gr; Pafilis and Maragou 2020). Its area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated at 128 km2 and its extent of occurrence (EOO) is 2,835 km2.",Done,Palearctic,"The population on Karpathos is considered to be relatively sparse (A. Christopoulos pers. comm. September 2023), although it is increasing due to a series of conservation actions implemented during the past decade. The same applies to the population on Rhodes, with the exception of two or three localities, where the species’ population seems to be denser (A. Christopoulos pers. comm. September 2023). Regarding the size and the trend of the Rhodes subpopulations, further research is needed, especially after the extensive wildfires that occurred on the island during July 2023.",Unknown,"This is a mostly aquatic species that is largely restricted to permanent still or slow-running waters, and it will not tolerate habitat disturbance. Breeding and larval development presumably take place in these waterbodies.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),There are no records of this species being utilised.,"Regarding the Karpathos population, although the sites from which the species is known are fairly remote, even small, low-scale habitat changes could be detrimental to the species due to very small number of individuals. Freshwater habitats are subject to a number of threats such as excessive water abstraction, which is occurring for agricultural purposes including livestock watering. Water availability is or at least was the main threat. Even in winter, the volume of naturally available water is really limited in the original sites and dispersal to other water bodies across the island is probably problematic due to low reproductive output and limited connectivity. Fires are an additional potential threat, both from locals who use fire to manage their lands and wildfires, which may increase with drier conditions. The species may be vulnerable to climate change, although the effects are not fully understood at a local level at present. A further potential threat is the intensive collection for scientific and research purposes exacerbated by the limited and localised distribution of this species, although there have not been any recorded incidences of this yet. There is some subsistence agriculture (sheep and goat keeping) that is occurring on the island; however, this is actually considered to be beneficial to the species' population as goats do not allow the vegetation to become too dense and their droppings feed the insects that this species preys on.  Regarding the Rhodes subpopulation, further research is needed in order determine the specific threats to the species.","Conservation Actions In-Place The species is listed on Annex V of the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) and Appendix III of the Bern Convention. In 2015, 10 adult individuals were translocated from Argoni to Olympos (Karpathos) to assist the establishment of the subpopulation in that locality, as part of the ""Conservation and study of the biology of the Karpathos Frog, the most endangered and unknown amphibian in Europe"" program (The Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund). The ""National Action Plan for the endemic Karpathos frog Pelophylax cerigensis"" (GREEN FUND) is being implemented since 2020. Among its actions was the clarification of the phylogenetic relationship between the species’ population on Karpathos Island and the population of P. cf. bedriagae from the neighbouring island of Rhodes. Complete mitogenome analysis showed that individuals from Karpathos and Rhodes form a well-supported monophyletic group with low genetic distance between them (p-distance=0.1%). Hence, the Rhodes populations seem to belong to P. cerigensis and not to P. bedriagae as formerly thought, highlighting the need for revision of P. cerigensis current conservation status (Toli et al 2023). Another action recently implemented is the creation of six new artificial ponds and the management of the existing ones in order to assist the Karpathos populations during the dry months.  Conservation Needed Continuation of monitoring, effective protection and appropriate management of the sites at which it is known to occur is necessary. Contrary to the high homogeneity of the two populations in the mitochondrial genome, subsequent analyses of genotypic data from ten microsatellite markers (Giannopoulou et al. 2023) revealed the existence of two distinct and highly differentiated gene pools, Karpathos and Rhodes, thus meeting the criteria to be characterised as distinct Management Units (MUs) (Moritz 1994). This should be considered when assessing the conservation status of the species, as well when planning targeted management actions.  Research Needed Although the available information on the Karpathos population has increased during the past decade, further monitoring of the population and habitat quality trends is needed.

In wide areas of the dry Mesaoria Plain in the central, eastern, and southeastern parts of the island, there are no records. Single subpopulations are often found around artificial water reservoirs and close to a few streams, especially in the Pediaios stream system. The lack of records in Northern part of Cyprus, particularly on the Karpas Peninsula, is likely due to sampling gaps. It occurs from sea level up to 1,700 m asl (https://www.herpatlas.cy).

It breeds by larval development, with its reproductive season occurring between March and June (Dufresnes 2019). Spawning takes place in stagnant water during the spring season each female lays compact egg masses that may contain up to 10,000 eggs in each clutch. Tadpoles remain in the water body until they metamorphose in the summer (https://www.herpatlas.cy).

Lymberakis pers. comm. October 2022), excessive drought which is caused by climate change, and urbanisation and tourism development of coastal areas. It is likely to be threatened by harvest and trade in Cyprus. Also, possible import of other Pelophylax species for consumption (frog legs) could threaten native species due to unintentional release to the wild and possible hybridisation (D. Cogalniceanu pers. comm. October 2022), so import of any other Pelophylax species should not be recommended (P.A. Crochet, pers. comm. October 2022).

Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal) is an emerging fungal pathogen affecting amphibians and is closely related to B. dendrobatidis (Bd), which has had a devastating impact on amphibian populations around the world. Both pathogens cause the infectious disease chytridiomycosis, and both are believed to have originated in Asia (for Bsal: Martel et al. 2014, for Bd: O'Hanlon et al. 2018). While Bd can cause disease in frogs, salamanders and caecilians, Bsal has only been reported to cause disease in salamanders and newts, although the pathogen has been detected in some frog species (Martel et al. 2013). Bd has spread globally, but at present Bsal is only known in Asia and has been introduced to Europe, most likely through the pet trade in salamanders (Martel et al. 2014, Nguyen et al. 2017). Currently in Europe, Bsal has been detected in the wild in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany (e.g. Thein et al. 2020) and Spain (Martel et al. 2020), and has been shown to be highly pathogenic to most urodelan taxa in Europe (Martel et al. 2014). Laboratory trials for susceptibility to Bsal are uncertain with regard to adult susceptibility to the disease. Only juveniles have been tested, but 100% mortality was observed (F. Pasmans and A.
