    <h1> Is Cutting Carbon Dioxide Emissions Enough? A Deeper Look at Wildlife Conservation</h1>
    <h2><strong>Our Question:</strong>
        <br>

        <blockquote>
            When people think about climate change, they often
            picture rising temperatures or increasing CO₂ levels—but
            climate change is far more complex than that. It also
            drives habitat loss, alters ecosystems, and reshapes how
            species survive and interact.

                    Different species respond to these pressures in
                    very different ways: some are more sensitive
                    to heat, others to land-use change or pollution.
                    <br>
                    In this project, you’ll explore how temperature rise, CO₂ concentration,
                    and habitat loss interact to shift extinction risk for amphibians
                    and reptiles. By adjusting these factors yourself, you can see
                    how multiple forces of climate change combine to threaten biodiversity.

                    <strong>Rising Temperatures</strong> <br> <br>
                    As temperature increases, reptiles are affected
                    more strongly than amphibians. This is because reptiles
                    rely more heavily on external heat to regulate their
                    body functions, where even small temperature changes
                    can disrupt their feeding, reproduction, and survival.
                    <br>
                    In the simulation, we see that reptile species shift into
                    higher risk categories faster than amphibians
                    as temperature rises.

                    <strong>Habitat Loss</strong> <br> <br>
                    Habitat loss impacts both amphibians and
                    reptiles in a similar way. As forests, wetlands,
                    and other natural environments disappear, both
                    groups lose critical space for breeding, shelter,
                    and food. This tells us that habitat loss has a 
                    very significant effect on the extinction risk of 
                    any species, regardless of their biological differences
                    making it an important factor to consider when protecting
                    species.
                    <br>
                    In the model, increasing habitat loss
                    causes steady risk increases for both groups at
                    nearly the same rate.

                    <strong>Increasing CO2 Levels</strong> <br> <br>
                    Rising CO₂ concentrations disproportionately
                    affect reptiles compared to amphibians. Higher
                    CO₂ drives larger climate shifts and ecosystem
                    changes that strongly disrupt reptile habitats,
                    especially in dry and open environments.
                    <br>
                    In the simulation, reptiles experience a much
                    sharper increase in extinction risk as CO₂ levels rise.

                    <strong>Conclusion</strong> <br> <br>
                    Climate change does not affect all species in
                    the same way. While reducing CO₂ emissions is
                    critical, it alone is not enough to protect
                    vulnerable wildlife.
                    <br>
                    Temperature rise, habitat
                    loss, and ecosystem disruption each drive
                    extinction risk through different pathways.
                    This means effective conservation must address
                    multiple pressures at once—cutting emissions,
                    protecting habitats, and managing land use—if
                    we want to prevent further species loss.
