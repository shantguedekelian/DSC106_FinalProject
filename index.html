                    <strong>Introduction</strong> <br> <br>
                    When people think about climate change, they often 
                    picture rising temperatures or increasing CO₂ levels—but 
                    climate change is far more complex than that. It also 
                    drives habitat loss, alters ecosystems, and reshapes how 
                    species survive and interact. Different species respond to 
                    these pressures in very different ways: some are more sensitive 
                    to heat, others to land-use change or pollution. In this 
                    project, you’ll explore how temperature rise, CO₂ concentration, 
                    and habitat loss interact to shift extinction risk for amphibians 
                    and reptiles. By adjusting these factors yourself, you can see 
                    how multiple forces of climate change combine to threaten biodiversity.

                    <strong>Rising Temperatures</strong> <br> <br>
                    As temperature increases, reptiles are affected 
                    more strongly than amphibians. Because reptiles 
                    rely heavily on external heat to regulate their 
                    body functions, even small temperature changes 
                    can disrupt their feeding, reproduction, and survival. 
                    In the simulation, reptile species shift into 
                    higher risk categories faster than amphibians 
                    as temperature rises.

                    <strong>Habitat Loss</strong> <br> <br>
                    Habitat loss impacts both amphibians and 
                    reptiles in a similar way. As forests, wetlands, 
                    and other natural environments disappear, both 
                    groups lose critical space for breeding, shelter, 
                    and food. In the model, increasing habitat loss 
                    causes steady risk increases for both groups at 
                    nearly the same rate.

                    <strong>Increasing CO2 Levels</strong> <br> <br>
                    Rising CO₂ concentrations disproportionately 
                    affect reptiles compared to amphibians. Higher 
                    CO₂ drives larger climate shifts and ecosystem 
                    changes that strongly disrupt reptile habitats,
                     especially in dry and open environments. In 
                     the simulation, reptiles experience a much 
                     sharper increase in extinction risk as CO₂ levels rise.

                    <strong>Conclusion</strong> <br> <br>
                    Climate change does not affect all species in 
                    the same way. While reducing CO₂ emissions is 
                    critical, it alone is not enough to protect 
                    vulnerable wildlife. Temperature rise, habitat 
                    loss, and ecosystem disruption each drive 
                    extinction risk through different pathways. 
                    This means effective conservation must address 
                    multiple pressures at once—cutting emissions, 
                    protecting habitats, and managing land use—if 
                    we want to prevent further species loss.

    <h3> What have you done so far? </h3>
    <p> We have created an interactive bar chart that filters between Amphibians and Reptiles, 
        and allows users to adjust sliders for temperature rise, habitat loss, and CO₂ increase. 
        As users manipulate these sliders, the risk levels for each species group are 
        updated in the visualization. This helps users understand how different environmental factors
        contribute to the extinction risk of these species. This will form the basis of our threat model,
        which will be at the end of the storytelling scroll section, where we will summarize the key insights.

    <h3> What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why? </h3>
    <p> The most challenging part of our project will be using animations to enhance our visualization.
        We want to create smooth transitions between different states of the visualization as users adjust 
        the sliders. Since we also plan on implementing a scroll animation, we want to make sure that these 
        features flow seamlessly, as any jumps or lags may disrupt the user.
        Animations can be tricky to implement effectively, as they require "perfect" timing. 
        If the animations are too fast or too slow, it can harm a visualization rather than enhance it.
        Therefore, we will need to do some testing on the timing and pacing of our animations to ensure 
        they are effective.
